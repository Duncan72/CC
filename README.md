Please make sure that WinPcap is installed in order to run Connection Cartographer (CC). CC will crash on startup if an internet connection is not available. CC has had issues functioning properly when run on a virtual machine, however it has worked as expected when run in a Windows-based sandbox. To run CC simply download the "CC_Executable" folder and then run "ConnectionCartographer.exe" inside of it. No install is required.
