Please make sure that WinPcap is installed in order to run Connection Cartographer (CC). CC will crash on startup if an internet connection is not available. CC has had issues functioning properly when run on a virtual machine, however it has worked as expected when run in a Windows-based sandbox.

CC will be improved in the future with enhanced performance and bug-fixes after I've settled into a job and have more time.

The maps were switched to Google Maps because Open Street Map was no longer returning map tiles.
